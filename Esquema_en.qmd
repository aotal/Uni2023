::: {.notes}
Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy, is a type of radiation therapy in which a radioactive substance is placed inside or directly next to the area requiring treatment. This allows for a high dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor or other affected tissue, while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissue. Brachytherapy is often used to treat cancers of the prostate, breast, cervix, and head and neck. It can also be used to treat other conditions, such as non-melanoma skin cancer and gynecological disorders.
