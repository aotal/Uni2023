  abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce volumetric modulated arc therapy treatments (VMAT) with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) for pancreatic cancer and describe dosimetric results on a large patient series. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 45 patients with pancreatic malignancies were treated with 18\,MV single-arc VMAT. Image guidance was performed with daily online kilo-volt cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) to the target volumes, PTV45Gy and PTV54Gy, and dose-volume indices to OARs from the QUANTEC task group were reported. The risk of clinical nephritis was evaluated using normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). Treatments were verified in-phantom with the Delta4 system. RESULTS: Average CI was 1.06 with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) of 0.97-1.22 for PTV45Gy and 1.17 (0.66-1.61) for PTV54Gy. HI of PTV54Gy was 1.06 (1.04-1.10). OAR constraints were achieved in all patients, except for kidneys V12Gy of 48 (35.4-72.3)\%. NTCP of the kidneys was 0.98 (0.6-1.7)\%. Kidneys V12Gy and V20Gy were inversely related to PTV54Gy CI and maximum dose. All in-phantom tests had gamma pass rates exceeding 95\% with global 3\% dose difference and 3\,mm distance to agreement. Patient shifts measured with CBCT had 95\% CI of -0.8, +0.8 in the RL, -0.7, +0.8 in the SI, and -0.8, +0.7\,cm in the AP directions. CONCLUSIONS: Dosimetric results of VMAT were excellent on PTVs and organs at risk. The kidneys represent the dose-limiting organ at risk for this technique. NTCP indicates that this technique is safe from radiation-induced side effects to the kidneys.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: For the purpose of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, a prototype magnetic resonance (MR) conditional afterloader was developed. This study demonstrates the development and testing of the prototype, while operating simultaneously with MRI. In combination with an MR-based method for HDR source localization, this development enables treatment verification of HDR brachytherapy. Additionally, this allows a direct reconstruction of the source dwell positions after catheter insertion (when using a dummy source) and introduction of a clinical workflow where the patient remains in the same position during dwell position reconstruction, treatment planning and irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prototype MR conditional afterloader was developed by providing radiofrequency (RF) shielding and a plastic source cable containing a dummy source. Simultaneous functioning of the afterloader and MRI acquisition was tested in an experimental setting where the afterloader was placed next to the scanner and programmed to send the source to predefined positions within a phantom, while acquiring MR images. The HDR source positions were determined using MR artifact simulation and matching of the MR images to the simulated artifact. Additionally, the impact of the presence and use of the afterloader on the MRI performance was investigated by assessment of RF interference, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and B\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown 0\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} field homogeneity. RESULTS: The experiments demonstrated that the prototype MR conditional afterloader and the MRI scanner fully functioned while operating simultaneously, without influencing the other system. The step sizes between the source positions obtained from the MR images corresponded with the afterloader settings. Besides, the MRI performance tests demonstrated no deterioration due to the presence or functioning of the afterloader next to the scanner. CONCLUSIONS: This research has demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneous MR acquisition and employment of an MR conditional afterloader. This development enables real-time HDR source localization for treatment verification of MRI-guided HDR brachytherapy using an MR conditional afterloader.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of perioperative I-125 low-dose-rate brachytherapy mesh implantation in pelvic locations in an animal model, before applying it clinically. Material and methods: The animal model was the Romanov adult ewe. Non-radioactive dummy I-125 seeds were implanted by laparotomy in the pelvic area. Forty-five dummy seeds were placed on a 10 cm{$^2$} polyglactin mesh to obtain a dose of 160 Gy at 5 mm from the center of each seed. Three CT scans were performed at day 15, day 70, and day 180 after surgery to check the positioning of the mesh for eventual seed migration according to bony landmarks and to perform a 3D theoretical dosimetric study. The experimental study design was based on Simon's minimax plan with a preliminary analysis of 10 ewes to validate the protocol and a second series of 7 ewes. Results: After the first step, 9 of 10 ewes were investigated. For 8 of 9 animals, the 160 Gy isodose line volume was within 10\%, showing feasibility of the procedure and allowing 7 more to be added. At the end of the study, 16 of 17 animals were examined. No seeds loss was observed. The volume difference of the 160 Gy isodose line was within 10\% in 13 of 16 ewes between the three CT scans. Twelve out of 16 had a coordinate deviation less than or equal to 10 mm on the three axes between the first and the third scans. Conclusions: These results show the technical feasibility of the pelvic mesh implantation in ewes. A phase I study for patients with locally advanced or recurrent pelvic tumors amenable to surgery, in combination with surgical resection should be possible.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review scientific literature on the use of intensity-modulated brachytherapy (IMBT), including static and dynamic shielding approaches, to enhance therapeutic ratio. Studies were evaluated for technique, disease site, dosimetry, applicators, dosimetric calculations, and planning algorithms. Comparisons with standard-of-care brachytherapy techniques, alternative IMBT methods, or both were performed for dose-to-target volumes, organs at risk (OARs), and treatment planning or delivery times. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Inclusion criteria were any peer-reviewed journal articles on IMBT published from January 1, 1980, to January 1, 2019, on PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and EBSCO databases. Two independent investigators reviewed each article for inclusion and exclusion criteria and scope. Data collected on each study included technique, source or shield material, disease site, n of study (n = number of simulated plans/treated patients), dose-to-target/OARs, and planning or delivery times. This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA). RESULTS: Database queries yielded 1734 results, which were reduced to 436 after exclusion criteria and 78 peer-reviewed journal articles after evaluation of scope. Studies per disease site were 31 for cervical; 16 for rectal; 10 for oculocutaneous; 7 for breast; 6 for prostate; and 8 for other, multiple, or no specific disease site. Eighteen studies demonstrated a significant decrease in dose to OARs (5.1\%-68.2\%), 11 improved treatment planning or delivery times (7.6\%-99.7\%), and 6 increased target coverage (18.6\%-71.6\%) relative to standard-of-care or alternative IMBT technique. IMBT consistently decreased dose to OAR compared with the standard of care at the cost of increased planning or delivery times. Innovations in dose calculation or planning algorithms and applicators were capable of ameliorating prolonged treatment intervals. CONCLUSIONS: IMBT techniques improved the therapeutic ratio by reducing OAR doses, facilitating dose escalation, or both. Static-shielding techniques are clinically available as a result of the advent of commercially available heterogeneity-corrected dose-calculation algorithms, whereas dynamic-shielding techniques are still preclinical.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to report clinical outcomes of patients treated with pulse-dose-rate brachytherapy (PDR-BT) for lip cancer after insufficient surgery. Material and methods: Twenty lip cancer patients were treated from January 2012 to September 2016. Primary treatment included surgery with or without reconstruction. All patients were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, most of the tumors were pT1. Brachytherapy procedures were done after post-operative wound healing. Median of three plastic tubes were implanted using a free-hand technique. Two PDR-BT treatments were scheduled for every patient, with the gap of median 13 days. The planned dose was 0.8-1 Gy per pulse to the total dose of 50 Gy from two PDR-BT treatments. Patients were evaluated every 3-6 months. Follow-up time was counted from the last day of treatment to any event or last visit. Early and late toxicities were scored with RTOG scale. Results: Average follow-up was 34.7 months (range, 12.7-67.6). Three- and five-year estimated disease-free survival was 95\% and local control was 100\%. One patient suffered from regional relapse in the submental region (IA lymph node group). Skin erythema or dry desquamation (grade 1) or wet desquamation (grade 2) was observed in 13 patients (65\%) and one patient (5\%), respectively. Six patients presented no acute toxicity. Moreover, there were no complications involving lip mucosa. All patients had grade 1 soft tissue fibrosis in the irradiated area, besides that, late toxicity included only skin complications. There were no significant factors associated with late toxicity {$\geq$} grade 2. Conclusions: PDR-BT in the adjuvant treatment of the lip cancer yields high local control with low toxicity. Even patients with close margins after surgery (\textexclamdown{} 5 mm) should be considered as candidates for PDR-BT.},

The radial (axial) MTF was measured using an edge method where the boundary of the third module of the ACR phantom, originally designed to measure uniformity and noise, was used as a circular edge. The 3D NPS was measured using images from this same module and using a previously-described methodology that quantifies noise magnitude and 3D noise correlation., Results: The axial MTF was radially symmetrical and had a value of 0.1 at 0.62 mm-1. The 3D NPS shape was consistent with the filter-ramp function of filtered-backprojection reconstruction algorithms and previously reported values. The radial NPS peak value was {$\sim$}115 HU2mm3 at {$\sim$}0.25 mm-1 and dropped to 0 HU2mm3 by 0.8 mm-1., Conclusions: The authors have developed an easily-implementable technique to measure the axial MTF and 3D NPS of clinical CT systems using an ACR phantom. The widespread availability of the phantom along with the free software the authors have provided will enable many different institutions to immediately measure MTF and NPS values for comparison of protocols and systems.},

Material and methods: Three available lunar ovoid sizes (22, 26, and 30 mm effective diameter) were evaluated. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed with a dummy wire inserted and with the Flexitron\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown\textregistered\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} source position simulator (SPS) at step sizes of 5 mm from the most distal dwell position. Treatment plans were generated in Oncentra\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown\textregistered\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} (version 4.5.3) with different catheter reconstruction techniques: centerline reconstruction, tracing a CT dummy wire, using a source path model provided by Elekta, and using the SPS at each planning dwell position. Source position agreement was assessed in registered CT images, and dose differences were calculated with the SPS-based treatment plan as a reference. Finally, dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were evaluated for clinical plans with the Venezia\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown TM\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} applicator. Results: For the most distal dwell position, the manufacturer's model had the closest agreement with the SPS at 0.6 {$\pm$}0.3 mm across applicator sizes. Relative to the SPS, maximal dose differences outside of the applicator were between 16-39\% for a 0.1 cm\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 3\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} volume and 3.6-9.1\% for a 2.0 cm\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 3\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} volume. For two clinical plans, volume-based DVH parameters agreed {$\leq$} 3.9\%, while deviations {$\leq$} 5.3\% were seen for point metrics. Conclusions: Relative to the SPS-based plan, large local dose discrepancies were reduced, but not eliminated, using the manufacturer's source path model. The choice of reconstruction technique was found to have relatively limited impact on DVH parameters for regions outside of the vaginal mucosa.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgically excised keloids reportedly recur at a rate of \textquestiondown 45\%. Post-excision radiation (RT) has been delivered via external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Despite historical data showing 10\% to 20\% keloid recurrences with post-excision RT, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence comparing keloid recurrences between the two RT modalities. OBJECTIVES: We performed the largest single-institution case-control retrospective study (2004-2014) of keloid recurrence rates and complications between post-excision EBRT and HDR brachytherapy. METHODS: One-hundred and twenty-eight patients, with 264 keloid lesions, were treated by excision alone (n = 28), post-excision EBRT (n = 197), or post-excision HDR brachytherapy (n = 39). Patient and keloid recurrence data were analyzed using mixed effect Cox regression modeling with a statistical threshold of P \textexclamdown{} .05. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of keloids recurred after surgical excision alone (9-month median follow up); 19\% of keloids recurred with post-excision EBRT (42-month median follow up); 23\% of keloids recurred with post-excision brachytherapy (12-month median follow up). Adjuvant EBRT and brachytherapy each showed significant control of keloid recurrence compared to excision alone (P \textexclamdown{} .01). EBRT significantly delayed the time of keloid recurrence over brachytherapy by a mean difference of 2.5 years (P \textexclamdown{} .01). CONCLUSIONS: Post-excision RT shows significant reduction in keloid recurrence compared to excision alone. While the recurrence control rates are not statistically different between EBRT and brachytherapy, keloids treated with EBRT recurred significantly later than those treated by HDR brachytherapy by a mean of 2.5 years. Further workup with a randomized control study will help to refine optimal adjuvant RT treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 3.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The MRI-guided cervical cancer brachytherapy provides unparalleled soft-tissue contrast for target and normal tissue contouring, but eliminates the ability to use conventional metallic fiducials for radiation source path reconstruction as required for treatment planning. Instead, the source path is reconstructed by manually aligning a library model to the signal void produced by the applicator, which takes time intraoperatively and precludes fully automated treatment planning. The purpose of this study is to present and validate an algorithm to automatically reconstruct tandem and ring applicators using MRI for cervical cancer brachytherapy treatment planning. METHODS: Applicators were reconstructed using T2-weighted MR images acquired at 1.5 T from 33 brachytherapy fractions including 10 patients using a model-to-image registration algorithm. The algorithm involves (a) image filtering and maximum intensity projection to highlight the applicator, (b) ring center identification using the circular Hough transform, and (c) three-dimensional surface model registration, optimized by maximizing the image intensity gradient normal to the model surface. Two independent observers manually reconstructed all applicators, enabling the calculation of interobserver variability and establishing a ground truth. Algorithm variability was calculated by comparing algorithm results to each individual observer, and algorithm accuracy was calculated by comparing algorithm results to the ground truth. The algorithm variability and accuracy were compared to the interobserver variability using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Mean {$\pm$} SD interobserver variability was 0.83 {$\pm$} 0.31 mm and 0.78 {$\pm$} 0.29 mm for the ring and tandem, respectively. The algorithm had mean {$\pm$} SD variability and accuracy of 0.72 {$\pm$} 0.32 mm (P = 0.02) and 0.60 {$\pm$} 0.24 mm (P = 0.0005) for the ring, and 0.70 {$\pm$} 0.29 mm (P = 0.11) and 0.58 {$\pm$} 0.24 mm (P = 0.004) for the tandem, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm variability and accuracy were within the interobserver variability measured in this study. The algorithm accuracy and mean execution time of 10.0 s are sufficient for clinical tandem and ring reconstruction, and are a step toward fully automated tandem and ring brachytherapy treatment planning.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nasal vestibular cancers are rare entities among the head and neck cancers. The treatment options are varied. Although surgical treatment plays an important role, postablative defects are difficult to reconstruct. This review aims to discuss the current views in the management of these cancers and issues related to the reconstruction of the complex surgical defects. RECENT FINDINGS: Nasal vestibular cancers are a distinct rare entity of head and neck cancers. These cancers are staged using the AJCC-TNM system for nonmelanoma cutaneous cancers of head and neck or the Wang classification. Early lesions are best treated by either surgery or radiation giving excellent cure rates. Advanced stages tumours need combined treatment with surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. Primary radiation therapy can be offered by external beam or interstitial brachytherapy. Surgical treatment varies from endonasal resections, Mohs' chemosurgery to open excisions. SUMMARY: Even though the Wang system of classification is used by majority of reports due its clinical utility, it has a drawback of not taking into account the tumour size as done by the AJCC system. Brachytherapy has been reported to be offering excellent cure rates with low morbidity in early tumours. Surgical treatment is also effective in early lesions, but its role is more established in advanced lesions. Reconstruction of the surgical defects is often a challenge, to preserve functional integrity and cosmesis. Various techniques, including skin grafts, local flaps, free flaps and prosthetics, form part of the reconstructive armamentarium.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: For 55 patients treated with interstitial multi-catheter breast brachytherapy the need for adaptive treatment planning was assessed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For all patients a treatment planning computed tomography (CT) and a follow-up CT were acquired and used for the retrospective evaluation. Keeping dwell time and dwell positions constant, the treatment plan assessed directly after catheter implantation was compared to the situation 48 h after implantation. Both manual catheter reconstructions, based on the planning and follow-up CT, were rigid registered to each other and the resulting deviations analyzed, like the difference between corresponding dwell positions ({$\Delta$}DP) or the discrete Fr\'echet distance. Further, the dosimetric changes, e.g., coverage index ({$\Delta$}CI), conformal index ({$\Delta$}COIN) and dose non-uniformity ratio ({$\Delta$}DNR) were considered for a deformed planning target volume (PTV) and the rigid warped PTV structure. The PTV was deformed according to the vector field estimated between the two acquired CTs. RESULTS: Over all patients with rigid aligned CTs a mean {$\Delta$}DP, {$\Delta$}CI, {$\Delta$}COIN and {$\Delta$}DNR were determined to 2.41 {$\pm$} 1.73 mm, 3.10 {$\pm$} 3.17\%, 0.009 {$\pm$} 0.007 and 0.036 {$\pm$} 0.040, respectively. Considering the deformed PTV {$\Delta$}CI was estimated to 5.05 {$\pm$} 4.14\%. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in 4\% of the cases re-planning would have been beneficial to ensure the planned dose delivery. Large PTV changes or large DP deviations were found to be the main reasons for dosimetric variations.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Irradiation of the tumor bed using interstitial multi-catheter brachytherapy is one of the treatment options for breast cancer patients. In order to ensure the planned dose delivery an advanced quality intervention method using an electromagnetic tracking (EMT) system is presented. The system is used to assess inter-fractional variations within the framework of a patient study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Until now 41 patients were included in the study for the evaluation and overall 355 EMT measurements were performed. The catheter traces are measured automatically and sequentially using an afterloader prototype (Flexitron, Elekta, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) equipped with an EMT sensor. The implant geometry is tracked directly after implantation, after CT imaging and after each irradiation fraction. The acquired data is rigidly registered to the catheter traces defined in the treatment plan and the dwell positions (DP) are reconstructed. DPs defined in treatment planning serve as reference. Breathing motion was corrected and recorded using three reference 6DoF sensors placed on the patients' skin. The Euclidean distance between the planned and reconstructed DPs provides information about possible inter-fractional deviations. Further, the influence of various factors on the occurrence of large deviations was investigated, like the patients' age, the length of the catheter, the breast volume, etc. RESULTS: Over all patient measurements a median Euclidean distance of 2.19 mm was determined between the reconstructed DPs and the reference DPs. The median deviation combining all datasets was minimal (1.67 mm) at the measurement directly after CT imaging. The deviations between the different fractions have a median distance of 2.31 mm which could be improved to 2.05 mm by adapting the treatment plan according to the follow-up CT. No correlation between the distance to the skin, ribs, mammilla or the breast volume and the occurrences of large deviations was found. The largest deviations were determined in the upper inner quadrant of the breast. CONCLUSION: The afterloader prototype could be well integrated into the clinical routine and is beneficial for ensuring the quality of the brachytherapy. Overall, a small median DP deviation, lower than the used step size of 2.5 mm, was detected.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate inter- and intra-observer variabilities of catheter reconstruction and its dosimetric impact for multi-catheter interstitial breast cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In order to evaluate inter-observer variabilities (IOV) three medical physicists reconstructed the catheter traces of 13 patients. These manual reconstructions were further compared to the automatic reconstruction algorithm integrated into the planning system and one on purpose imprecise manual reconstruction. For intra-observer variabilities (IAV) repeated reconstructions of two physicists were compared for 13 patients. In total 426 catheters were considered. Keeping dwell times, dwell positions, the optimization and the normalization relative points constant the geometrical deviations between the corresponding dwell positions of the reference data set and the investigated reconstructions were evaluated. Also, the effect on the quality indices, such as coverage index (CI), dose non-uniformity ratio (DNR) or conformal index (COIN), and the exposure of the organs at risk were analyzed. RESULTS: Over all patients and all different catheter reconstructions considered for IOV a mean deviation between the corresponding dwell positions of 0.60 {$\pm$} 0.35 mm was detected. The first observer had a mean deviation of 0.54 {$\pm$} 0.32 mm, whereas the second observer yielded a mean deviation of 0.58 {$\pm$} 0.37 mm. The length of the catheter traces varied in the mean by 0.51 {$\pm$} 0.45 mm. The mean relative deviation of the CI, DNR, COIN, mean heart dose and mean lung dose varied by 0.27 {$\pm$} 0.31\%, 0.0027 {$\pm$} 0.0025, 0.0036 {$\pm$} 0.0033, 0.024 {$\pm$} 0.019\%, 0.05 {$\pm$} 0.11\%, respectively. The skin dose (D\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown 0.2ccm\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown ) changed in the maximum 8.52\%. On average IAV reached a deviation between the corresponding dwell positions of 0.49 {$\pm$} 0.30 mm. IOVs and IAVs proved to be significantly different (Wilcoxon's test p \textexclamdown{} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The study proved that a repeated reconstruction of the catheter traces does not lead to large geometrical deviations or to a significant change in the dose exposure. But the lack of ground truth makes the estimation of the quality of the reconstruction challenging. A precise reconstruction mapping the reality is a necessity for the planned dose delivery. With all considered reconstruction techniques reliable quality indices for the target and the organs at risk could be obtained.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Brachytherapy is a cost-effective method for the management of oral cavity cancers in low to middle income countries. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-IBT) in patients with oral cavity cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2013, 78 patients (49 combined external beam radiotherapy [EBRT] plus IBT and 29 IBT monotherapy) with oral cavity cancers had been treated in our center. Slightly more than half the patients were male, and the median age was 54 years. The treatment was planned based on the Paris system. The main outcomes were disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 36.5 months (range, 1.17-54.23). The actuarial four-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 83\% and 65\%, respectively. The local and locoregional control was achieved among 89.74\% and 87.17\% of patients, respectively. None of the factors including tumor size, node status, gender, and radiation modality (IBT alone vs. IBT + EBRT) had a significant statistical correlation to the local control rate. All the patients tolerated the planned treatment in the IBT alone group. Late complications included a case of trismus and three cases of catheter insertion site fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: HDR-IBT as a monotherapy or in combination with EBRT is an appropriate option for the management of oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas, and supports the improvement in treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles in adjuvant settings.},

In order to explore the therapeutic benefit of surgical resection and adjuvant brachytherapy, the authors reviewed their experience utilizing interstitial brachytherapy (IBT) at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Methods: A retrospective chart review of the 51 patients who received salvage surgical resection of lymphatic recurrences and adjuvant IBT between 1993 and 2012 at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center was undertaken. All patients underwent neck dissection with complete resection and intraoperative placement of afterloading brachytherapy catheters. Soft tissue reconstruction was performed as necessary. The technical aspects of IBT were reviewed, and the overall and disease free survival rates and the recurrence rates were determined. Results: All patients had received external beam radiation (EBRT) as part of their initial treatment to a median dose of 66 Gy; 40 and 68\% of the patients also had a neck dissection or chemotherapy, respectively. The cumulative regional recurrence probability is 28 and 38\% at 5 years and 10 years. All of the patients underwent salvage neck dissection and IBT, with 81\% also undergoing soft tissue reconstruction. The median dose delivered to the tumor bed was 60 Gy over a median duration of 4.5 days. There were 21 early adverse events, 8 of which were severe, and 19 late adverse events, 6 of which were severe. The most common early and late adverse events due to surgery and brachytherapy were dysphagia (7.1\%) and true vocal cord paralysis (17.9\%), respectively. There were no perioperative deaths or carotid hemorrhages. Nineteen patients developed recurrence including regional recurrence and distinct metastasis. The median time to recurrence is 130 months using Kaplan-Meier product limit method. The 2-year disease-free survival rate was 58\%. The 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival rates were 69, 56, and 46\%, respectively. Conclusions: Regional recurrences in previously irradiated tissues after the definitive treatment of primary head and neck cancers represent a challenging problem. We demonstrated that salvage neck dissection with IBT provided encouraging regional control and survival rates, while maintaining relatively low acute and long-term toxicity rates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brachytherapy involves placement of radioactive sources inside or near the tumour. For gynaecological cancer, recent developments, including 3D imaging and image-guided adaptive brachytherapy, have improved treatment quality and outcomes. However, for large or complex tumours, target coverage and local control with commercially available applicators remain suboptimal. Moreover, side effects are frequent and impact on quality of life. This signifies that brachytherapy treatment conformity can improve. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop 3D printed personalised brachytherapy applicators with a custom vaginal topography and guided needle source channels, based on the patients' anatomy. METHODS: Customised applicators were derived from MRI data of two gynaecological cancer patients. Needle channels were planned by the Radiation Oncologist during image segmentation. Applicators contained multi-curved channels for 6F needles (ProGuide, Elekta) and were manufactured using a digital light processing-based 3D printer. Needle channel radius constraints were measured by analysing needle insertion forces in a 3D printed template, and imposed on the designs. RESULTS: Two customised needle applicators are presented. Interstitial needle channels have tapered ends to increase needle protrusion angle accuracy. Additional structures were included to serve as anchor points in MR images for applicator and needle modelling and reconstruction during treatment planning. An insertion force analysis yielded a radius constraint of 35 mm to minimise the risk on needle jamming or buckling. For radii larger than 50 mm, no differences in insertion forces were found. CONCLUSION: A novel method to design and produce vaginal topography-based 3D prints for personalised brachytherapy applicators, derived from patient MRI data, is presented. The applicators include curved needle channels that can be used for intracavitary and guided interstitial needle placement. Further spatial optimisation of brachytherapy source channels to the patient anatomy is expected to increase brachytherapy conformity and outcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (PRT/PCRT) represent an increasingly used clinical strategy in different tumor sites. We have previously reported on a PRT/PRCT protocol in patients with locally advanced non-inflammatory breast cancer (LABC) with promising clinical results. However, concerns regarding a possible unfavorable influence on cosmesis still exist. Thus, the aim of the current study was to examine long-term cosmetic outcome in our series of LABC patients treated with PRT/PCRT followed by breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy (ME). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of the 315 patients treated with PRT/PCRT in the years 1991 to 1999, 203 were still alive at long-term follow-up of mean 17.7 years (range 14-21). Thirty-seven patients were lost to follow-up and 58 patients refused to be contacted, which resulted in 107 patients (64 patients after BCS and 43 after mastectomy) being available and willing to undergo further cosmetic assessment. One patient had a complete response after PRT/PCRT and refused surgery. PRT/PCRT consisted of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with 50 Gy (5 \texttimes{} 2 Gy/week) to the breast and the supra-/infraclavicular lymph nodes combined with a consecutive electron boost or (in case of BCS) a 10-Gy interstitial brachytherapy boost with Ir-192 prior to EBRT. Overall, chemotherapy was administered either prior to RT or concomitantly in the majority of patients. BCS and mastectomy were performed with and without reconstruction. The cosmetic outcome was assessed by patient questionnaire, panel evaluation, and breast retraction assessment (BRA) score. RESULTS: Eighty percent of all BCS patients rated their overall cosmetic result as "excellent" or "good" as compared to 55.8\% after mastectomy. Patient and panel ratings on cosmetic outcomes were similar between the two groups. No grade III or IV fibrosis were detected in any of the groups. The median BRA score after breast conserving surgery was 2.9. CONCLUSION: PRT/PCRT is associated with low grades of fibrosis and a good to excellent long-term cosmetic outcome.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the dose calculation accuracy in water medium of the Advanced Collapsed cone Engine (ACE) for three sizes of COMS eye plaques loaded with low-energy I-125 seeds. METHODS: A model of the Oncura 6711 I-125 seed was created for use with ACE in Oncentra\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown\textregistered\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} Brachy (OcB) using primary-scatter separated (PSS) point dose kernel and Task Group (TG) 43 datasets. COMS eye plaque models of diameters 12, 16, and 20 mm were introduced into the OcB applicator library based on 3D CAD drawings of the plaques and Silastic inserts. To perform TG-186 level 1 commissioning, treatment plans were created in OcB for a single source in water and for each COMS plaque in water for two scenarios: with only one centrally loaded seed, or with all seed positions loaded. ACE dose calculations were performed in high accuracy mode with a 0.5 \texttimes{} 0.5 \texttimes{} 0.5 mm\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 3\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} calculation grid. The resulting dose data were evaluated against Monte Carlo (MC) calculated doses obtained with MCNP6, using both local and global percent differences. RESULTS: ACE doses around the source for the single seed in water agreed with MC doses on average within \textexclamdown{} 5\% inside a 6 \texttimes{} 6 \texttimes{} 6 cm\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 3\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} region, and within \textexclamdown{} 1.5\% inside a 2 \texttimes{} 2 \texttimes{} 2 cm\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 3\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} region. The PSS data were generated at a higher resolution within 2 cm from the source, resulting in this improved agreement closer to the source due to fewer approximations in the ACE dose calculation. Average differences in both investigated plaque loading patterns in front of the plaques and on the plaque central axes were {$\leq$} 2.5\%, though larger differences (up to 12\%) were found near the plaque lip. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, good agreement was found between ACE and MC dose calculations for a single I-125 seed and in front of the COMS plaques in water. More complex scenarios need to be investigated to determine how well ACE handles heterogeneous patient materials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Permanent seed brachytherapy is an established treatment option for localized prostate cancer. Currently, post-implant dosimetry is performed on CT images despite challenging target delineation due to limited soft tissue contrast. This work aims to develop an MRI-only workflow for post-implant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy seeds. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prostate mimicking phantom containing twenty stranded I-125 dummy seeds and calcifications was constructed. A three-dimensional gradient-echo MR sequence was employed on 3T and 1.5T MR scanners. An optimized quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique was applied to generate positive contrast for the seeds and calcifications. Seed numbers, centroids, and orientations were determined using unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-means and K-medoids clustering). The geometrical seed positions and the resulting dose distribution were compared to the clinical CT-based approach. RESULTS: The optimized QSM-based method generated high quality positive contrast for the seeds that were significantly different from that for calcifications and could be easily differentiated by thresholding. The estimated seed centroids from both 3T and 1.5T MR data were in perfect agreement with the standard CT-based seed detection algorithm (maximum difference of 0.7 mm). The estimated seed orientations were highly correlated with the actual orientations (R \textquestiondown{} 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MRI-based workflow enabling an accurate and robust means to localize the seeds (position and orientation) upon validation on complex seed configurations, has the potential to replace the current widely practiced CT-based workflow.},

  abstract = {With the recent clinical implementation of real-time MRI-guided x-ray beam therapy (MRXT), attention is turning to the concept of combining real-time MRI guidance with proton beam therapy; MRI-guided proton beam therapy (MRPT). MRI guidance for proton beam therapy is expected to offer a compelling improvement to the current treatment workflow which is warranted arguably more than for x-ray beam therapy. This argument is born out of the fact that proton therapy toxicity outcomes are similar to that of the most advanced IMRT treatments, despite being a fundamentally superior particle for cancer treatment. In this Future of Medical Physics article, we describe the various software and hardware aspects of potential MRPT systems and the corresponding treatment workflow. Significant software developments, particularly focused around adaptive MRI-based planning will be required. The magnetic interaction between the MRI and the proton beamline components will be a key area of focus. For example, the modeling and potential redesign of a magnetically compatible gantry to allow for beam delivery from multiple angles towards a patient located within the bore of an MRI scanner. Further to this, the accuracy of pencil beam scanning and beam monitoring in the presence of an MRI fringe field will require modeling, testing, and potential further development to ensure that the highly targeted radiotherapy is maintained. Looking forward we envisage a clear and accelerated path for hardware development, leveraging from lessons learnt from MRXT development. Within few years, simple prototype systems will likely exist, and in a decade, we could envisage coupled systems with integrated gantries. Such milestones will be key in the development of a more efficient, more accurate, and more successful form of proton beam therapy for many common cancer sites.},

It has been found that the published data for the low dose rate CSM11 Cs-137 source lacks of smoothness in some regions because the data are too noisy. The purpose of this study was to calculate the dosimetric data for this source in order to provide quality dosimetric improvement of the existing dosimetric data of Ballester et al. [1]. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to obtain the dose rate distributions Monte Carlo simulations were done using the GEANT4 code. A spherical phantom 40 cm in radius with the Cs-137 source located at the centre of the phantom was used. RESULTS: The results from Monte Carlo simulations were applied to derive AAPM Task Group 43 dosimetric parameters: anisotropy function, radial dose function, air kerma strength and dose rate constant. The dose rate constant obtained was 1.094 {$\pm$} 0.002 cGy h-1 U-1. The new calculated data agrees within experimental uncertainties with the existing data of Ballester et al. but without the statistical noise of that study.

Ultrasound is an attractive alternative with reasonable costs and high soft tissue depiction quality. This technical note aims to demonstrate the proof of principle for use of TRAns Cervical Endosonography with rotating transducer in the context of brachytherapy (TRACE BT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: TRACE BT presentation is based on a single stage IIB cervical cancer patient. Prior to second BT implant, rotating US transducer (6.9 mm diameter) was inserted in cervical canal and axial images obtained at 10 MHz, focal range of 30 mm, and axial resolution of 0.4 mm. Size and topography of hypo-echoic areas were assessed and optimal positions of interstitial needles were determined. Finally, intracavitary applicator was placed and needles inserted through vaginal ring-template according to TRACE pre-plan. MRI-based high risk clinical target volume (CTVHR) dimensions were compared with hypoechoic areas on TRACE. Topography of parametrial needles on post-insertion MRI was compared with TRACE pre-plan. RESULTS: Insertion of rotating mechanism into cervico-uterine cavity was safe, feasible and fast. The 360\textdegree{} imaging in axial plane enabled real-time assessment of cervix, uterus, and adjacent parametria. Qualitative comparison of TRACE with post-insertion MRI revealed favorable agreement of findings. In-plane size of CTVHR on MRI was comparable to hypoechoic areas on TRACE. Needle positions on post-insertion MRI corresponded to TRACE-based pre-plan. Main limitation of TRACE was gradual deterioration of image quality due to coupling gel removal. CONCLUSIONS: Present proof of concept demonstrates potential role of TRACE-BT for cervical cancer as an attractive high-tech approach with reasonable costs. Prior to investigation of its clinical role, further development of TRACE methodology is needed. This includes reliable transducer-tissue coupling, applicator reconstruction, imaging range, limitations in extensive tumors, US-based contouring concepts, registration with other imaging methods, organ dose-assessment, real-time dosimetry, etc.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a method combining CT scout images with axial images to improve the localization accuracy of catheter tips in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT scout images were utilized along with conventionally reconstructed axial images to aid the localization of catheter tips used during HDR treatment planning. A method was developed to take advantage of the finer image resolution of the scout images to more precisely identify the tip coordinates. The accuracies of this method were compared with the conventional method based on the axial CT images alone, for various slice thicknesses, in a computed tomography dose index (CTDI) head phantom. A clinical case which involved multiple interstitial catheters was also selected for the evaluation of this method. Locations of the catheter tips were reconstructed with the conventional CT-based method and this newly developed method, respectively. Location coordinates obtained via both methods were quantitatively compared. RESULTS: Combination of the scout and axial CT images improved the accuracy of identification and reconstruction of catheter tips along the longitudinal direction (i.e., head-to-foot direction, more or less parallel to the catheter tracks), compared to relying on the axial CT images alone. The degree of improvement was dependent on CT slice thickness. For the clinical patient case, the coordinate differences of the reconstructed catheter tips were 2.6 mm {$\pm$} 0.9 mm in the head-to-foot direction, 0.4 mm {$\pm$} 0.2 mm in the left-to-right direction, and 0.6 mm {$\pm$} 0.2 mm in the anterior-to-posterior direction, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combining CT scout and axial images demonstrates the ability to provide a more accurate identification and reconstruction of the interstitial catheter tips for HDR brachytherapy treatment, especially in the longitudinal direction. The method developed in this work has the potential to be implemented clinically together with automatic segmentation in modern brachytherapy treatment planning systems, in order to improve the reconstruction accuracy of HDR catheters.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: There are perineal templates for interstitial implants such as MUPIT and Syed applicators. Their limitations are the intracavitary component deficit and the necessity to use computed tomography (CT) for treatment planning since both applicators are non-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibles. To overcome these problems, a new template named Template Benidorm (TB) has been recently developed. Titanium needles are usually reconstructed based on their own artifacts, mainly in T1-weighted sequence, using the void on the tip as the needle tip position. Nevertheless, patient tissues surrounding the needles present heterogeneities that complicate the accurate identification of these artifact patterns. The purpose of this work is to improve the titanium needle reconstruction uncertainty for the TB case using a simple method based on the free needle lengths and typical MRI pellets markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposed procedure consists on the inclusion of three small A-vitamin pellets (hyperintense on MRI images) compressed by both applicator plates defining the central plane of the plate's arrangement. The needles used are typically 20 cm in length. For each needle, two points are selected defining the straight line. From such line and the plane equations, the intersection can be obtained, and using the free length (knowing the offset distance), the coordinates of the needle tip can be obtained. The method is applied in both T1W and T2W acquisition sequences. To evaluate the inter-observer variation of the method, three implants of T1W and another three of T2W have been reconstructed by two different medical physicists with experience on these reconstructions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The differences observed in the positioning were significantly smaller than 1 mm in all cases. The presented algorithm also allows the use of only T2W sequence either for contouring or reconstruction purposes. The proposed method is robust and independent of the visibility of the artifact at the tip of the needle.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Treatment for gynecologic cancers, such as cervical, recurrent endometrial, and vaginal malignancies, commonly includes external-beam radiation and brachytherapy. In high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy, radiation treatment is delivered via hollow needles that are typically inserted through a template on the perineum with a cylinder placed in the vagina for stability. Despite the need for precise needle placement to minimize complications and provide optimal treatment, there is no standard intra-operative image-guidance for this procedure. While some image-guidance techniques have been proposed, including magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, X-ray computed tomography (CT), and two-dimensional (2D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), these techniques have not been widely adopted. In order to provide intra-operative needle visualization and localization during interstitial brachytherapy, we have developed a three-dimensional (3D) TRUS system. This study describes the 3D TRUS system and reports on the system validation and results from a proof-of-concept patient study. METHODS: To obtain a 3D TRUS image, the system rotates a conventional 2D endocavity transducer through 170 degrees in 12 s, reconstructing the 2D frames into a 3D image in real-time. The geometry of the reconstruction was validated using two geometric phantoms to ensure the accuracy of the linear measurements in each of the image coordinate directions and the volumetric accuracy of the system. An agar phantom including vaginal and rectal canals, as well as a model uterus and tumor, was designed and used to test the visualization and localization of the interstitial needles under idealized conditions by comparing the needles' positions between the 3D TRUS scan and a registered MR image. Five patients undergoing HDR interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy were imaged using the 3D TRUS system following the insertion of all needles. This image was manually, rigidly registered to the clinical postinsertion CT scan based on the vaginal cylinder of the needle template. The positions of the tips and the trajectory of the needle paths were compared between the modalities. RESULTS: The observed geometric errors of the system were {$\leq$} 0.3 mm in each of the three coordinate planes of the 3D US image and the mean measured volumetric error was 0.10 cm\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 3\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} . In the phantom study, the mean needle tip difference was 1.54 {$\pm$} 0.71 mm and the mean trajectory difference was 0.94 {$\pm$} 0.89 degrees (n = 14). In the in vivo study, a total of 73 needles were placed, of which 88\% of needles were visible and 79\% of tips were identifiable in the 3D TRUS images. Six of the nine needles that were not visible were due to shadowing artifacts created by the presence of the vaginal cylinder of the needle template. The mean distance between corresponding needle tips in the two modalities was 3.82 {$\pm$} 1.86 mm and the mean trajectory difference was 3.04 {$\pm$} 1.63 degrees for the five patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study, the 3D TRUS system allowed for localization of needles not obscured by shadowing artifacts, providing a method for visualizing needles intra-operatively during HDR interstitial brachytherapy of gynecologic cancers and providing the potential for 3D image-guidance.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To present the implementation of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pre-planning technique in multi-interstitial perineal and endocavitary gynecological brachytherapy. Material and methods: We used a new fully MRI-compatible applicator that is capable to engage titanium needles, and an intrauterine tandem, developed in our department for the treatment of gynecological cervical cancer patients. This applicator is an attempt to combine the technical advantages of the Martinez universal perineal interstitial template (MUPIT) with the improvement in dose distribution by adding an intrauterine probe with the imaging advantages of MRI-based brachytherapy, thus preserving the stability, geometry, and robustness of the implant, avoiding possible errors of free-hand needle placement. A pre-brachytherapy MRI T2 acquisition is carried out with the template in place 3-5 days before the implant. On this image set, clinical target volume (CTV) is drawn. The required needles and their depths are selected accordingly to encompass the CTV (as conformal as possible). To facilitate this task, a Java based application linked to the treatment planning system has been developed. From this procedure, each needle identification and its depth are obtained previously to the implantation. With this information, the radiation oncologist proceeds with implant and then, a post-implant MRI is carried out, in which the contouring, needles, tandem reconstruction, and optimization are established. Results: This pre-planning procedure has been successfully applied in 10 patients. An excellent reproduction of the virtual pre-planning has been achieved. Conclusions: We describe a virtual pre-planning technique using a multi-interstitial and endocavitary perineal template. It is based on a virtual work with MRI images. This procedure has shown to be feasible and efficient in clinical practice by facilitating the work of specialists, and reducing uncertainties of the application.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The EMBRACE II study combines state-of-the-art Image-Guided Adaptive Brachytherapy in cervix cancer with an advanced protocol for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) which specifies target volume selection, contouring and treatment planning. In EMBRACE II, well-defined EBRT is an integral part of the overall treatment strategy with the primary aim of improving nodal control and reducing morbidity. The EMBRACE II EBRT planning concept is based on improved conformality through relaxed coverage criteria for all target volumes. For boosting of lymph nodes, a simultaneous integrated boost and coverage probability planning is applied. Before entering EMBRACE II, institutes had to go through accreditation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As part of accreditation, a treatment planning dummy-run included educational blocks and submission of an examination case provided by the study coordinators. Seventy-one centers submitted 123 EBRT dose distributions. Replanning was required if hard constraints were violated or planning concepts were not fully accomplished. Dosimetric parameters of original and revised plans were compared. RESULTS: Only 11 plans violated hard constraints. Twenty-seven centers passed after first submission. 27 needed one and 13 centers needed more revisions. The most common reasons for revisions were low conformality, relatively high OAR doses or insufficient lymph node coverage reduction. Individual feedback on planning concepts improved plan quality considerably, resulting in a median body V43Gy reduction of 158 cm\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 3\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} from first plan submission to approved plan. CONCLUSION: A dummy-run as applied in EMBRACE II, consisting of training and examination cases enabled us to test institutes' treatment planning capabilities, and improve plan quality.},

Appropriate imaging to find retained surgical instruments allows for timely diagnosis and retrieval of the vaginal foreign body. CASE: The patient is a 33-year-old woman with recurrent cervical cancer who was undergoing radiation therapy. During interstitial implantation, a reverse cutting needle was broken into the anterior vaginal wall. Three-dimensional endoluminal ultrasonography allowed for timely retrieval with minimal surgical exploration in the operating room. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative three-dimensional endoluminal ultrasonography allows for accurate visualization and mapping of a vaginal foreign body. This highlights an innovative and highly useful feature of this imaging technique.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The PORTEC-4a trial investigates molecular-integrated risk profile guided adjuvant treatment for endometrial cancer. The quality assurance programme included a dummy run for vaginal brachytherapy prior to site activation, and annual quality assurance to verify protocol adherence. Aims of this study were to evaluate vaginal brachytherapy quality and protocol adherence. METHODS: For the dummy run, institutes were invited to create a brachytherapy plan on a provided CT-scan with the applicator in situ. For annual quality assurance, institutes provided data of one randomly selected brachytherapy case. A brachytherapy panel reviewed and scored the brachytherapy plans according to a checklist. RESULTS: At the dummy run, 15 out of 21 (71.4\%) institutes needed adjustments of delineation or planning. After adjustments, the mean dose at the vaginal apex (protocol: 100\%; 7 Gy) decreased from 100.7\% to 99.9\% and range and standard deviation (SD) narrowed from 83.6-135.1 to 96.4-101.4 and 8.8 to 1.1, respectively. At annual quality assurance, 22 out of 27 (81.5\%) cases had no or minor and 5 out of 27 (18.5\%) major deviations. Most deviations were related to delineation, mean dose at the vaginal apex (98.0\%, 74.7-114.2, SD 7.6) or reference volume length. CONCLUSIONS: Most feedback during the brachytherapy quality assurance procedure of the PORTEC-4a trial was related to delineation, dose at the vaginal apex and the reference volume length. Annual quality assurance is essential to promote protocol compliance, ensuring high quality vaginal brachytherapy in all participating institutes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We developed a novel and simple method to measure the source positions in applicators directly for high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy based on Cherenkov emission imaging, and evaluated the performance. METHODS: The light emission from plastic applicators used in cervical cancer treatments, irradiated by an \textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 192\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} Ir {$\gamma$}-ray source, was captured using a charge-coupled device camera. Moreover, we attached plastics of different shapes, including tapes, tubes, and plates to a metal applicator, to use as screens for the Cherenkov imaging. We determined the source positions and dwell intervals from the light profiles along with the applicator and compared these with preset values and dummy marker measurements. RESULTS: The source positions and dwell intervals measured from the light images were comparable to the dummy marker measurements and preset values. The distance from the applicator tip to the first source positions agreed with the dummy marker measurements within 0.2 mm for the plastic tandem. The dwell intervals measured using the Cherenkov method agreed with the preset values within 0.6 mm. The distances measured with three plastic types on the metal applicator also agreed with the dummy marker measurements within 0.2 mm. The dwell intervals measured using the plastic tape agreed with the preset values within 0.7 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method should be suitable for rapid and easy quality assurance (QA) investigations in HDR brachytherapy, as it enables source position using a single image. The method allows for real-time, filmless measurements of the source positions to be obtained and is useful for rapid feedback in QA procedures.},
